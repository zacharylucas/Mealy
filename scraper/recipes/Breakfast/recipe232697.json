{"minutes": 25, "title": "Cream Cheese Arepas", "rating": 4.59999990463257, "ingredients": ["3/4 cup milk at room temperature", "1/4 cup cream cheese at room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon white sugar", "1 cup arepas flour (such as P.A.N.\u00ae)", "1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed"], "instructions": "Mix milk, cream cheese, and salt in a mixing bowl; whisk together until smooth and foamy. Add sugar and arepas flour to milk mixture; mix with a spatula until dough is soft, thick, and workable, about 1 minute.\nDivide dough into 4 portions (for the 4 wells in the maker). Form each quarter into a ball and use wet hands to gently shape it into a thick patty about 1/2-inch thick. If you see little cracks on the outside, the dough may be a little too dry; add more milk.\nHeat arepas maker; lightly coat wells of the arepas machine with vegetable oil.\nPlace patties into wells of maker, close lid, and let cook through one cooking cycle of machine, about 5 minutes. For a crisper crust, flip arepas, using a wooden spoon or spatula, and repeat cooking cycle for 5 more minutes. Patties will be crusty and browned on both sides and the insides will be cooked all the way through.\n", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/1019939.jpg"}
