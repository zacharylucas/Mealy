Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 30 minutes.\nMelt 6 tablespoons butter in a pot over medium-high heat until butter turns golden and has a nutty fragrance, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add marshmallows and peanut butter, and cook and stir until marshmallows and peanut butter are melted and mixture is well-combined. Remove from heat.\nStir rice cereal and kosher salt into marshmallow mixture until cereal treat mixture is well-combined. Cool to room temperature.\nRoll \"yolk\" mixture into gumball-size balls, about 1/2 teaspoon \"yolk\" mixture per ball. Scoop about 1/3 cup cereal treat mixture into your hand and form it into a 2-inch round; press an indentation into the center with your finger and place 1 \"yolk\" in the indentation. Wrap the cereal treat around the \"yolk\" and squeeze firmly to form an egg shape. Repeat with remaining cereal treat mixture and \"yolks.\" Set completed \"eggs\" on a plate and refrigerate until firmed, at least 15 minutes.\nMelt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
