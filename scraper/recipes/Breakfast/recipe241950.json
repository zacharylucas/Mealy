Prepare a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Put an oven rack in the middle tier of the oven.\nBeat eggs, half-and-half, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth.\nArrange 6 bread slices into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Spread about half the ham and half the spinach over the bread. Sprinkle half the green onions and half the Cheddar cheese over the ham and spinach. Spread the bread cubes over the layers and pour 1 cup of the egg mixture over everything. Repeat layering of ham, spinach, green onions, and Cheddar cheese and pour remaining egg mixture over the top.\nCover dish with plastic wrap. Put some soup cans atop the plastic wrap to help keep ingredients immersed in liquid; refrigerate at least 15 minutes.\nBake in preheated oven until the liquid sets in the middle of the dish, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 155 degrees F (68 degrees C).
