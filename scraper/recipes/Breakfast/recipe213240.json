Place three acorn squash halves cut-side-down into each baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the squash is very tender and the skin begins to separate from the meat, about 1 hour. Remove, discard the water, and set aside until cool enough to handle.\nScoop the acorn squash flesh from the skins and into a blender. Add the cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. Puree until thick and smooth. Scrape the squash into a heavy-bottom pot, and stir in the brown sugar and apple juice concentrate. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until thickened, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool completely before packing into freezer-safe containers. Store in the freezer up to 6 months.\n", "title": "Acorn Squash Butter", "ingredients": ["3 acorn squash, halved and seeded", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "2 1/4 cups brown sugar", "1 (12 fluid ounce) can frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed"], "minutes": 180}
