Trim any thick pieces of dense, hard fat from the roast, but leave smaller areas of fat in place.\nIn a bowl, mix 2 cups of beef base with minced garlic, and rub the mixture generously all over the roast. Sprinkle the roast with 1/2 cup of fresh thyme, 1/2 cup of oregano, the black peppercorns, and salt. Place into a roasting pan.\nRoast in the preheated oven until the meat has formed a brown crust and a quick-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast measures 135 degrees F (57 degrees C), for medium-rare, about 3 hours. If you prefer the meat well-done, roast an additional 45 minutes. Remove roast from oven, and allow to stand while you make the sauce. Temperature of the meat will rise about 10 more degrees as it rests.\nPour the water into a saucepan, and dissolve 1 tablespoon of beef base in the water. Mix in the red wine, and stir in 1 teaspoon of thyme, 1 teaspoon of oregano, and the garlic powder. Add the celery, onion, and carrot pieces to the sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring often, until the sauce reduces by half, 20 to 30 minutes. Strain sauce and discard vegetables before serving sauce with the roast.\n", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/1050950.jpg"}
