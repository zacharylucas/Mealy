{"minutes": 35, "instructions": "Heat oil in deep-fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nWhisk together the flour, cornmeal, garlic salt, garlic powder, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Mix in beer until no dry lumps remain. Dip the cod into the batter, allow some of the excess to run off, then carefully place into the deep-fryer. Cook until golden brown and crispy on the outside, and the fish is easily flaked, about 8 minutes. Cook the fish in several batches to avoid over loading the deep fryer.\n", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/4581281.jpg", "rating": 4.82352924346924, "title": "Fish Batter with Newcastle\u2122 Brown Ale", "ingredients": ["1 quart vegetable oil for frying", "1/2 cup flour", "1/2 cup cornmeal", "1 teaspoon garlic salt", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 cup brown ale (such as Newcastle\u2122 brown ale)", "1 pound cod fillets, cut into pieces"]}
