Place the kombu and water in a saucepan, and allow it to soak for 30 minutes to become soft.\nRemove the kombu from the water, and cut several lengthwise slits into the leaf. Return the kombu to the water, and bring it to a boil. As soon as the water begins to boil, remove the kombu to prevent the stock from becoming bitter.\nStir the bonito flakes into the kombu-flavored water, bring back to a boil, and take the pan off the heat. Allow the water to cool. When the bonito flakes have settled to the bottom, strain the dashi through a strainer lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter.\n", "title": "Dashi Stock (Konbudashi)", "ingredients": ["1 ounce dashi kombu (dried kelp)", "1 quart water", "1/2 cup bonito flakes"], "minutes": 60}
