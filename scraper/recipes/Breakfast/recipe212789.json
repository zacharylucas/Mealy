Mix thoroughly, then gradually stir in the flour. Dough will be sticky. Divide dough into thirds and wrap with waxed paper. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\nPreheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nCombine the remaining 1/4 cup of butter with the brown sugar, cinnamon, pecans, and raisins. Set aside. Roll one ball of dough at a time to a 9 inch circle on a floured surface, while keeping the remaining dough chilled. Spread 1 tablespoon of the optional orange marmalade over the circle. Gently press 1/3 of the nut mixture into the dough. Cut the circle into 16 wedges. Roll each wedge tightly, starting with the wide end. Place the cookie point-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Beat the egg white with the water in a small bowl, then brush the mixture onto each cookie.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.\n", "title": "Best Ever Rugelach", "ingredients": ["1 cup cottage cheese", "1 cup butter, softened", "2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup butter, softened", "3/4 cup brown sugar", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "3/4 cup chopped pecans", "1/2 cup raisins (optional)", "3 tablespoons orange marmalade (optional)", "1 egg white", "2 tablespoons water"], "minutes": 190}
