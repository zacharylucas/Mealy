Sprinkle garlic powder, ground black pepper, onion and rosemary on eggs while cooking.\nPlace hot pasta and cooked eggs on a plate and stir together; the broken yolks will create the sauce. Serve hot.\n", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/2371809.jpg", "rating": 3.92592597007751, "title": "Eggs and Spaghetti", "ingredients": ["4 ounces spaghetti", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 eggs", "2 teaspoons garlic powder", "2 teaspoons ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon minced onion", "1 tablespoon dried rosemary"]}
