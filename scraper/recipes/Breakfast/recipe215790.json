{"ingredients": ["1 pound dry spaghetti", "1 pound bacon, cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces", "1 large sweet onion (such as Vidalia\u00ae), chopped", "2 (4.5 ounce) cans sliced mushrooms, drained", "2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce"], "title": "Bacon and Mushroom Spaghetti", "instructions": "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nWhile the pasta is cooking, brown the bacon with onion in a large pan over medium heat until the bacon is almost crisp, about 10 minutes; drain excess fat, and stir in the mushrooms and tomato sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil. Return the cooked spaghetti to the pot, mix with sauce, and serve.\n", "rating": 3.5, "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/2254754.jpg", "minutes": 35}
