{"minutes": 120, "title": "Apricot Brown Sugar Ham", "rating": 4.71794891357422, "ingredients": ["1 (10 pound) fully-cooked spiral cut ham", "2/3 cup brown sugar", "1/3 cup apricot jam", "1 teaspoon dry mustard powder"], "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).\nPlace the ham cut side down onto a sheet of aluminum foil. I like to put the shiny side up. Mix together the brown sugar, apricot jam and mustard powder in a small bowl. Brush onto the ham using a pastry or barbeque brush. Reserve any leftover glaze. Enclose the foil around the ham and place on a rimmed baking sheet.\nRoast for 2 hours in the preheated oven, or if your ham is a different size, figure 14 minutes per pound. Apply the remaining glaze 20 minutes before the ham is done.\n", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/1118499.jpg"}
