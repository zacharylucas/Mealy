{"ingredients": ["2 1/2 cups white sugar", "2/3 cup light corn syrup", "1/3 cup water", "2 egg whites", "1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed", "1/2 cup peanut butter, or as needed"], "title": "Peanut Butter Divinity Roll", "instructions": "Mix sugar, corn syrup, and water together in a deep pan; bring to a boil. Heat to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball (hard ball stage), about 15 minutes.\nBeat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.\nSlowly pour sugar mixture over egg whites while beating with an electric mixer. Beat until candy clings to a spoon and loses some of its shine. Spread candy mixture onto a sheet of waxed paper; sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Generously spread peanut butter over candy mixture. Roll candy into one large roll; cut into 2 rolls. Slice each roll into desired pieces.\n", "rating": 3.57142853736877, "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/1848928.jpg", "minutes": 35}
