Set aside.\nHeat a large, heavy skillet over high heat, and add the vegetable oil. When oil just begins to smoke, drop in the flat iron steaks and quickly sear until steaks are browned, about 3 minutes. Flip the steaks and sear the other side for another 3 minutes; remove steaks immediately, or lower the burner temperature and cook to the desired degree of doneness.

Sprinkle the tomato and avocado side with about 1/2 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar, and place a hot browned steak on the mozzarella cheese. Fold each sandwich closed to serve.\n"}
