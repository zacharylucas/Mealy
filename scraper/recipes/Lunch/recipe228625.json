{"minutes": 95, "title": "Pear Jam", "rating": 4.54545450210571, "ingredients": ["4 1/2 cups mashed ripe pears", "3 tablespoons powdered fruit pectin", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/4 cup lemon juice", "7 1/2 cups white sugar", "1 teaspoon butter", "8 half-pint canning jars with lids and rings, or as needed"], "instructions": "Mix pears, fruit pectin, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, and lemon juice in a large heavy pot; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add sugar all at once, stirring, and bring back to a full rolling boil. Boil for 1 minute. Mix in butter to settle foam.\nSterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the pear jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.\nPlace a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.\n", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/4554157.jpg"}
