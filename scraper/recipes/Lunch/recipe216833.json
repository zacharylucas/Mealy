Now blend in the seafood seasoning.\nPour shrimp stock into the cream cheese mixture, blending together with a wire whisk until smooth. Blend in the warmed half-and-half. Allow the mixture to simmer, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until there is steam rising from the pot. Add the diced potatoes, keeping the heat on medium-high.
