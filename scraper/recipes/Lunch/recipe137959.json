Pour in chicken stock, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add shelled edamame and continue cooking until the edamame and onions are both soft.\nPour into a blender and carefully puree until smooth; or use a stick blender, and puree the beans in the saucepan.
