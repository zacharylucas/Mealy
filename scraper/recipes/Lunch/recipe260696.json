Line a muffin tin with parchment paper squares.\nGrate cauliflower into a microwave-safe bowl using a fine grater. Chop up any remaining pieces that are too small to grate but too big for the crust.\nMicrowave cauliflower until soft and tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Pour cauliflower into a clean dish towel cool easily handled, 15 to 20 minutes.\nWrap the towel around the cauliflower and squeeze out as much liquid as possible; the drier the cauliflower is, the better it will hold together as a crust once mixed with the other ingredients.\nCombine cauliflower, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a large bowl.\nScoop cauliflower crust mixture into prepared muffin tin, dividing the mixture evenly among the cups. Pat down cauliflower mixture with the back of a spoon, making it compact.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.\nSpoon a small amount of pizza sauce onto each cauliflower crust. Top with remaining 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, dividing evenly among the crusts.\nBake until golden brown and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Let sit in pan for 5 minutes before moving each bite to a cooling rack. Let cool for 10 minutes. Peel parchment paper squares off the crusts and serve on a platter.\n"}
