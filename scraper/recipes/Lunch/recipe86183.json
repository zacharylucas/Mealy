Then peel, and place in a large bowl. With a large fork or potato masher, mash potatoes for 15 to 20 seconds (they do not need to be mashed smooth).\nSpoon the potatoes into a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in butter, water, tomato sauce, and half-and-half. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme. Stir in cashews, and mix well. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer until cashews are soft, about 50 to 60 minutes.\n", "minutes": 135, "ingredients": ["4 large sweet potatoes", "1/3 cup butter", "8 cups water", "1/2 cup tomato sauce", "2 tablespoons half-and-half", "2 teaspoons salt", "1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 pinch dried thyme", "1 cup cashew halves"], "rating": 3.0, "title": "Creamy Sweet Potato Soup", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/962819.jpg", "calories": "370"}
