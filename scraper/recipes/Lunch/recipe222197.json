Set aside.\nMix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.\nStir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.\nLightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.\nPreheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).\nStretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.\nSlide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.\n", "title": "Authentic Pizza Margherita", "ingredients": ["3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 cup water", "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast", "1 pinch white sugar", "1/4 cup flour for dusting", "2 cups pizza sauce", "20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese", "20 leaves fresh basil", "olive oil", "sea salt to taste"], "minutes": 105}
