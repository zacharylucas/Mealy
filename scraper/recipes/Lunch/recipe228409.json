Cut the dough into 1- to 1 1/2-inch squares.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and gently drop the dumplings into the boiling water a few at a time, stirring to keep them from sticking. Boil until all dumplings have risen to the top, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from water with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl.\nBring chicken broth to a boil in a large soup pot and whisk in cream of chicken soup and cream until soup is smoothly combined.
