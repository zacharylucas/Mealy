Add broccoli and broth, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.\nPour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot.\nIn small saucepan, over medium-heat melt 3 tablespoons butter, stir in flour and add milk. Stir until thick and bubbly, and add to soup. Season with pepper and serve.\n", "ingredients": ["2 tablespoons butter", "1 onion, chopped", "1 stalk celery, chopped", "3 cups chicken broth", "8 cups broccoli florets", "3 tablespoons butter", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 cups milk", "ground black pepper to taste"], "title": "Best Cream Of Broccoli Soup", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/4223268.jpg"}
