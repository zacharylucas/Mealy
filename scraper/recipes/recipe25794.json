Grease a 9x13 inch pan.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the oats, sweetened condensed milk, butter, coconut, almonds, chocolate chips and cranberries with your hands until well blended. Press flat into the prepared pan.\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, depending on how crunchy you want them. Lightly browned just around the edges will give you moist, chewy bars. Let cool for 5 minutes, cut into squares then let cool completely before serving.\n", "ingredients": ["3 cups quick-cooking oats", "1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk", "2 tablespoons butter, melted", "1 cup flaked coconut", "1 cup sliced almonds", "1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips", "1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries"], "title": "Easy Granola Bars", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/466805.jpg"}
