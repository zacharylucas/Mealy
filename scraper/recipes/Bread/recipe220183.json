{"ingredients": ["1/4 cup whole wheat flour", "3 cups all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast", "1 1/4 teaspoons salt", "1/4 teaspoon white sugar", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 cups warm water (100 degrees F or 38 degrees C)", "all-purpose flour, for dusting"], "title": "Easy Homemade Pizza Dough", "instructions": "Stir whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, yeast, salt, sugar, olive oil, and warm water with a spatula until formed into a sticky ball of dough that pulls away from sides of a large bowl, about 3-4 minutes.\nCover the bowl with a light cloth or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) for 18 hours, until doubled in size.\nPreheat the oven to 550 degrees F (280 degrees C). Sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal.\nTurn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and sprinkle with more flour. Form the dough into a rectangle, and cut it into four equal parts. Shape each piece into a ball, stretching and tucking the dough to create a smooth surface, adding more flour if needed. Cover the dough balls with a towel and let rest for 15 minutes.\nTo shape the dough, sprinkle the surface with flour and lightly pat flat. Use a rolling pin to form a thin disk about 9 inches in diameter.\nTransfer the formed crust to the prepared baking sheet and top as desired. Bake on the bottom rack for 4 minutes, move to the middle rack and bake for 5-6 minutes more minutes, until the bottom is crispy and the top is lightly browned. Move to cooling rack to cool slightly before serving.\n", "rating": 4.35294103622437, "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/3124026.jpg", "minutes": 1115}
