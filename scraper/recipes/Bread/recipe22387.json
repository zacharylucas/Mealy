Spray two 9x5 inch loaf pans with non-stick cooking spray, add just enough cornmeal to coat.\nIn the bowl of an upright mixer, combine the flour, yeast and salt; stir well to combine. Pour in the water; mix until a stiff dough forms. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in preheated oven for 15 minutes.\nDeflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. With very sharp knife, cut shallow slash in tops of loaves. Lightly dust loaves with flour, cover with towel, and put back in oven. Let rise until at least doubled, about 45 minutes. Remove loaves from oven, keep covered, and preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nReturn uncovered loaves to preheated oven. Bake until golden brown and loaves sound hollow when tapped on the top.\n"}
