Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove the chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Place the chicken on the grill and cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 to 8 minutes per side.
