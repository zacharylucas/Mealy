Squeeze out excess moisture with cheese cloth.\nCombine spinach, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a food processor; blend until smooth. Add flour; blend until dough no longer sticks to the blades, adding flour as needed.\nRoll dough into a ball; wrap in plastic wrap. Rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.\nRemove plastic wrap from dough. Transfer to a work surface generously dusted with flour; cut dough into 4 pieces with a sharp knife. Roll out dough with a rolling pin to 1/4-inch thickness; shape into rectangles.\nDust pasta maker rollers with flour. Run the dough rectangles through a pasta maker on the widest setting.
