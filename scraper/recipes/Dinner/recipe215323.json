Bring to a boil over medium heat, skim off any foam that forms on the top, reduce heat to low, and simmer the stock for 3 hours. Strain the stock, skim off the fat, and set aside. There should be about 4 cups of stock.\nSkim off and discard all but 1/4 cup of the fat from the drippings in the roasting pan, and place the roasting pan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, then cook and stir the flour mixture until it becomes pale golden brown, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the stock and tomato paste; bring to a boil, simmer for 5 minutes, then whisk in the red currant jelly. Simmer for 10 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.\n", "title": "Holiday Turkey Gravy", "ingredients": ["1 pound giblets, neck, and clipped wing tips from turkey", "2 carrots, roughly chopped", "1 stalk celery, roughly chopped", "6 cups water", "2 cups chicken stock", "1 1/2 cups turkey drippings from roasted turkey", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 tablespoons red currant jelly", "salt and ground black pepper to taste"], "minutes": 215}
