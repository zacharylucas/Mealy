{"minutes": 40, "title": "Paul's Favorite Chicken", "rating": 4.13333320617676, "ingredients": ["5 slices bacon", "4 ounces thinly sliced ham", "1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into chunks", "1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese"], "instructions": "Place the bacon into a large skillet over medium-high heat, and fry until crisp. Drain most of the grease, leaving enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Hold up the pieces of bacon with tongs, and use scissors to snip it into pieces, letting it fall back into the pan.\nTear the ham into small pieces, and sprinkle them in with the bacon. Stir for a minute, then add the chicken pieces. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.\nAt the very end, reduce the heat to medium-low, and sprinkle some of the cheese to coat everything. Stir to melt into a sauce that should coat all of the meat. Sprinkle in the rest of the cheese, and cook until everything is coated and cheese has thickened slightly, about 1 minute.\n", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/587168.jpg"}
