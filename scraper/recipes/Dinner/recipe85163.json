Cook until they open, 5 to 10 minutes - you will hear the juice sizzling on the hot coals when this happens.\nRemove the oysters from the grill, and pry off the top shell. You may want to wear some heavy gloves to protect from the heat. Slide a knife between the oyster and shell to disconnect. Top each one with 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce and salt to taste. Serve in the shell while still warm.\n", "title": "Grilled Oyster Shooters", "ingredients": ["8 fresh oysters in shells", "1/3 cup Fresh lemon juice", "3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "hot pepper sauce to taste", "salt to taste"], "minutes": 15}
