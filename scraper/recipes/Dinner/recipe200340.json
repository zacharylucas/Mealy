Set aside. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nCook the steaks until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
