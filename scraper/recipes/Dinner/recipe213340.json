Return all the meat to the Dutch oven, sprinkle with flour, and stir lightly to coat the meat with flour. Stir in onion, carrots, dark beer, bay leaves, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil, and cover.\nPlace the Dutch oven into the preheated oven, and cook for 45 minutes; uncover, stir the stew, and cook until the beef is very tender and the liquid is reduced by half, about 45 more minutes.\nPlace the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble the bacon and set aside.\nAbout 30 minutes before the stew is ready, make the colcannon: Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.\nPlace the cabbage into a microwave-safe bowl, and add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water. Cover and microwave on High for about 2 1/2 minutes; uncover (watch out for steam) and stir the cabbage. Cover and microwave for about 2 1/2 more minutes, until the cabbage is slightly tender but not mushy. Drain excess liquid, and set the cabbage aside, covered.\nPlace the potatoes into a large bowl, and add milk, butter, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Beat the potatoes with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir in the cabbage, crumbled bacon, and parsley until well combined.\nTo serve, place a scoop of colcannon onto a plate, make a hollow, and fill with braised beef stew.\n", "title": "Beer Braised Irish Stew and Colcannon", "ingredients": ["Irish Stew:", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "1 (3 pound) beef chuck roast, trimmed of fat and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 cup coarsely chopped onion", "1 cup coarsely chopped carrot", "1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle dark beer", "2 bay leaves", "1 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "Colcannon:", "3 slices bacon", "2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks", "2 cups thinly sliced cabbage", "1/4 cup milk, warmed", "2 tablespoons butter", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley"], "minutes": 180}
