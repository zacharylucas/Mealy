{"ingredients": ["1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed", "1 head garlic cloves, separated and peeled", "3 fresh jalapeno peppers", "1 bunch fresh cilantro", "1/2 cup water, or as needed", "salt and pepper to taste"], "title": "Roasted Tomatillo and Garlic Salsa", "instructions": "Preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange the whole cloves of garlic, tomatillos, and jalapenos on a baking sheet. Place under the broiler, and cook for a few minutes. Remove garlic cloves first, as soon as they are toasted, to avoid developing a bitter flavor. Continue to roast jalapenos and tomatillos until evenly charred, turning occasionally. Set aside to cool. Don't remove the charred parts of the tomatillos or the peppers. They add a really nice flavor.\nPlace peppers and tomatillos in a blender with the garlic and cilantro. Add a little water to the mixture if necessary to facilitate blending. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate until serving.\n", "rating": 4.61344528198242, "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/702016.jpg", "minutes": 40}
