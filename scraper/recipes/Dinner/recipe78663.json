Grease a 2-quart baking dish; set aside.\nPlace the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry until cool enough to handle.\nMeanwhile, place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Chop the bacon coarsely; set aside.\nSlip the skins off the potatoes and discard; blend the potatoes in an electric blender or food processor until smooth. Stir in the butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, cream, and milk. Mix well; season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread the potato mixture in the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 18 minutes. Remove from the oven; sprinkle the potatoes with the bacon. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 5 minutes.\n"}
