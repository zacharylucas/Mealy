Scoop the mixture onto a serving bowl and shape into an oval.\nIn a bowl, beat eggs and salt and pepper. Heat a small skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Add egg mixture; cook over medium heat. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. Use a spatula to gently fold the eggs into a cocoon shape. When eggs are completely set, remove from the heat.\nPlace the omelet on top of the rice and run a knife length-wise through the top layer of the omelet.
