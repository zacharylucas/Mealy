{"minutes": 30, "ingredients": ["2 pounds tomatillos, husked", "2 fresh jalapeno peppers", "3 cloves garlic, peeled", "1 dash cloves", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 dash black pepper", "1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules, or salt"], "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/702875.jpg", "rating": 4.55319166183472, "title": "Morelos Salsa Verde", "instructions": "Place tomatillos, jalapenos, and garlic in a large pot. Pour in just enough water to cover the tomatillos; they will float, so press them down with your hand as you measure the water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the color of the tomatillos lightens to a yellow color, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool for about 10 minutes.\nStrain the tomatillos, reserving the water. Place into the bowl of a blender; add the cloves, cumin, pepper, and chicken bouillon. Puree until smooth, use the reserved water as needed to adjust the consistency.\n"}
