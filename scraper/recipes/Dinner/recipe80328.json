Roll on a lightly oiled clean surface until the mixture looks like a large ground beef hot dog with about 1 1/2 inches at each end of the skewer. Place your fingers in the middle of the skewer and separate the meat log into two sausages with about 1 inch of skewer sticking out at each end.\nPrepare a grill for high heat, or if you only have a grill pan, like myself, heat it over medium-high heat.\nPlace the sausages on the grilling surface, and cook for about 10 minutes, turning once or twice for even cooking. Serve immediately.\n", "title": "Kofta", "ingredients": ["1 pound ground beef", "1 onion, diced", "1 egg yolk", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano", "salt and pepper to taste", "1 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 20 minutes"], "minutes": 30}
