Stir in the cream of celery soup and milk. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and stir in 1 tablespoon of the French fried onions. Sprinkle the remaining onions on top.\nBake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. While the casserole is baking, prepare the stuffing according to package directions. Spread over the top of the casserole. I like to mash it flat with a spatula so that it covers the entire dish.\nReturn to the oven for about 10 minutes, or until crunchy. You can also broil for a few minutes for extra crunch.\n", "title": "Ultimate Side Dish", "ingredients": ["1 (15.5 ounce) can French-style green beans, drained", "1 (15 ounce) can sliced potatoes, drained", "1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup", "1 1/8 cups milk", "3 tablespoons French-fried onions, divided", "salt and pepper to taste", "garlic powder to taste", "1 (8 ounce) package dry bread stuffing mix"], "minutes": 50}
