Add the garlic salt and seasoned salt; shake the mixture together in the bag to combine. Pour the cereal crumb mixture out into a shallow bowl.\nIn another shallow bowl, beat the egg with the milk. Dip each chicken breast half into the milk mixture, then into the crumb mixture, coating the chicken well with crumbs. Place the coated chicken breasts into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cereal coating is golden brown, the chicken is no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\n", "title": "Crispy Baked Cereal Chicken", "ingredients": ["4 cups crispy rice cereal squares (such as Rice Chex\u00ae)", "1 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt", "1 egg", "1 1/2 cups milk", "4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves"], "minutes": 55}
