Press cumin seed and pepper equally onto both sides of chops. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Place each chop between sheets of plastic wrap; with a flat mallet or rolling pin, gently pound meat to 1/4 inch thick, pounding as close to the bone as possible.\nIn a 2- to 3-quart pan over high heat, bring 2 cups broth to a boil. Stir in couscous, cover tightly, and remove from heat; let stand until broth is absorbed and couscous is tender to bite, about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, set a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add chops, without crowding, in a single layer, and turn as needed to brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes total. As chops are cooked, transfer to a rimmed plate.\nMeanwhile, rinse orange; cut in half lengthwise, then cut 1 half crosswise into thin slices, discarding seeds. Cut remaining orange half into 4 wedges.\nReturn all chops and any accumulated juices to pan. Add sliced orange and 1/3 cup broth; cover and simmer over low heat until meat is no longer pink in the center (cut to test), about 4 minutes.\nSpoon couscous equally onto plates. Arrange chops and orange slices alongside; drizzle pan juices evenly over meat. Accompany with orange wedges to squeeze over pork. Add salt to taste.\n", "title": "Pork Chops with Cumin and Orange", "ingredients": ["4 center-cut loin pork chops (each about 3/4 in. thick and 6 oz.)", "3/4 teaspoon cumin seed", "3/4 teaspoon coarse-ground pepper", "Salt", "2 1/3 cups fat-skimmed chicken broth", "1 1/2 cups couscous", "1 (8 ounce) orange"], "minutes": 35}
