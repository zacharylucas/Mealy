{"instructions": "Scrub potatoes and cut each in half. In a 9- by 13-inch pan, mix potatoes with 2 teaspoons oil, then turn potatoes cut side up.\nBake in a 425 degree oven for 10 minutes. Turn potatoes cut side down and bake until barely tender when pierced, about 10 minutes longer.\nMeanwhile, with a vegetable peeler, pare peel (orange part only) from orange. Mince peel. In a small bowl, combine peel, remaining 2 teaspoons oil, oregano, cumin, chili powder, chopped cilantro, and pepper.\nRinse salmon and pat dry. Rub seasoning mixture on cut sides of fish.\nPush potatoes to sides of pan. Set salmon steaks in a single layer in the center of the pan. Bake until salmon is opaque but still moist-looking in the center of the thickest part (cut to test), 8 to 10 minutes.\nAs salmon bakes, use a small, sharp knife to cut membrane from orange; discard. Cut between membranes to release fruit segments; discard any seeds.\nTransfer salmon steaks to warm plates, and add equal portions of potatoes. Garnish with orange segments and cilantro sprigs. Add salt to taste.\n", "minutes": 40, "ingredients": ["1 pound red thin-skinned potatoes (about 1 1/2 in. wide)", "4 teaspoons olive or salad oil", "1 (8 ounce) orange, rinsed", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon chili powder", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro", "1/2 teaspoon pepper", "4 (6 ounce) salmon steaks (3/4 in. thick each)", "Cilantro sprigs", "Salt"], "rating": 4.16666650772095, "title": "Oven-roasted Salmon Steaks with Red Potatoes", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/986114.jpg", "calories": "428"}
