Cook and stir the green onions, ham, and peas in the hot oil until onions have softened, about 2 minutes. Stir the pineapple chunks into the wok; cook until pineapple begins to darken, about 2 minute. Push ingredients to the side of the wok, and pour beaten egg in the center. Cook until egg begins to set, about 30 seconds. Stir together all contents of the wok.\nMix the cooled rice, sugar, salt, white pepper, and garlic powder into the wok; stir constantly to keep from sticking.
