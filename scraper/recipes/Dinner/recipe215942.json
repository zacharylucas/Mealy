Once the water is boiling, stir in the broccoli rabe, and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Return the water to a boil, and stir in the macaroni. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nWhile the pasta is cooking, cook and stir the walnut halves in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Set the walnuts aside, add the olive oil, and reduce heat to low. Stir in the garlic, and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in the broccoli rabe, and cook 3 minutes to reheat. Season to taste with salt and black pepper, then stir in the drained pasta and walnuts. Toss with Parmesan cheese before serving.\n", "title": "Rapini-Walnut Macaroni", "ingredients": ["1 bunch broccoli rabe (rapini), trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 (8 ounce) box uncooked macaroni pasta", "1/2 cup walnuts", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 large cloves garlic, sliced", "salt and black pepper to taste", "1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese"], "minutes": 30}
