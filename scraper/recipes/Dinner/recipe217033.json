Stir in the cabbage, onion, celery, carrots, and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ground round and the egg; cook and stir until the meat is brown and the egg is no longer runny.\nPlace a tortilla onto your work surface, then spoon 3 large tablespoons of the filling halfway between the bottom edge and the center of the tortilla.
