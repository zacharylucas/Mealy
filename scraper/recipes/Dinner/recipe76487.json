Divide each loaf of frozen bread dough into 6 pieces, and roll into balls. Set aside.\nCrumble the ground beef into a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Drain off grease. Add the water, cabbage, onion, and garlic. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring as needed, until the cabbage is soft. Season with salt and pepper to taste. I like to use more pepper than salt. Drain off any excess liquids, and set aside.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the dough balls into 5 inch (approximate) squares. Place about 3/4 cup of the cabbage burger into the center, fold the dough over, and pinch to seal. Place on a baking sheet with the seam side down.\nBake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, and brush with melted butter. Serve hot.\n", "title": "Cabbage Burgers", "ingredients": ["3 (1 pound) loaves frozen bread dough, thawed", "5 pounds ground beef", "1/4 cup water", "1 large head cabbage, chopped", "1 large onion, chopped", "2 cloves garlic, chopped", "salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons butter, melted"], "minutes": 21}
