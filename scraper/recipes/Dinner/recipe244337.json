{"ingredients": ["1 (19 ounce) package Smithfield\u00ae Peppercorn & Garlic Seasoned Pork Tenderloin", "4 eggs, beaten", "1 (8 ounce) package panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs)", "2/3 cup all-purpose flour", "Vegetable oil for frying"], "title": "Pork Fries", "instructions": "Remove tenderloin from packaging and place on cutting board; cut into 3 equal length sections, each about 3 inches long. Slice each section into 1/4- to 1/2-inch diameter strips. You will end up with approximately 34 strips that are similar in size and shape to French fries.\nPlace eggs, breadcrumbs and flour into separate bowls. Dredge pork strips in flour, coat with beaten egg, and toss in breadcrumbs.\nPour oil into large skillet until 1/4 inch deep; heat over medium-high until breadcrumb dropped in oil sizzles. Gently place approximately 8 breaded pork strips into oil, making sure not to overcrowd them. Fry approximately 1 1/2 minutes per side until golden brown, crisp, and internal temperature of pork is at least 150 degrees F.; drain on paper towels. Repeat until all pork strips are fried. Note that stove temperature may need to be reduced to prevent burning when the oil level lowers after a few batches.\nServe with BBQ sauce, sriracha mayonnaise, or ranch dressing for dipping.\n", "rating": 4.8461537361145, "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/2702138.jpg", "minutes": 37}
