{"minutes": 15, "ingredients": ["2 slices white bread", "1 (4 ounce) beef hamburger patty", "1 teaspoon mayonnaise", "1 egg", "1 slice American cheese"], "rating": 4.59090900421143, "title": "Burly Burger", "instructions": "Place the bread in a toaster set to your desired level of darkness. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the hamburger patty for about 5 minutes per side, until cooked through. While the patty is cooking, spread mayonnaise on one side of each piece of toasted bread and place them on a plate, mayonnaise side up.\nOnce the patty is cooked through, transfer it to one slice of bread. Crack the egg into the skillet and fry until the yolk is firm, about 3 minutes if you cover the pan. Place the egg onto the patty when done and top with a slice of cheese. Top with the other slice of bread. When finished, it should look like a sandwich.\n", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/3400852.jpg"}
