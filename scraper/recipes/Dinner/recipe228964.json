Let the zucchini drain for 2 to 3 hours if possible. Transfer zucchini to several layers of paper towels and squeeze out as much liquid as possible.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.
