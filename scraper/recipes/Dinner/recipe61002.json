{"ingredients": ["9 medium potatoes, peeled", "1 teaspoon salt", "3 eggs, beaten", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup bread crumbs", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 cup butter", "2 tablespoons finely chopped onion", "1/4 cup dry bread crumbs"], "title": "Kartoffel Kloesse (Potato Dumplings)", "instructions": "Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until the potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes. Drain water, and place potatoes into a large bowl. Mash potatoes, leaving them slightly lumpy (just like making mashed potatoes). Mix in the salt, eggs, flour, 2/3 cup of bread crumbs, and nutmeg. Roll into walnut sized balls. If the dough is too sticky, you may want to mix in more flour or bread crumbs.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Gently drop the dumplings into the water. When they come up to the surface, allow them to boil uncovered for 3 minutes. Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon, and keep warm.\nWhile you are waiting for the water to boil, melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. Cook, stirring constantly, until the onions are tender, and the sauce has thickened some. Pour sauce over the dumplings before serving.\n", "rating": 4.25641012191772, "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/485238.jpg", "minutes": 30}
