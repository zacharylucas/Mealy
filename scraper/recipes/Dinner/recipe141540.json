Add water to cover, then bring to a boil. Skim and discard the foam that has floated to the surface. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered until the chicken is tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Place the chicken into a bowl and shred it into strips as thick as a pencil; set aside. Strain the cooking liquid and discard the vegetables.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onions, green peppers, and red peppers. Cook and stir until the vegetables have softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in tomato puree, white wine, chicken, and enough of the reserved broth to create a thick sauce. Season with cumin, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 5 minutes more to reduce the sauce slightly and coat the shredded chicken.\n", "title": "Chicken Ropa Vieja", "ingredients": ["1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast", "1 small onion, quartered", "1 tomato, quartered", "1 carrot, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces", "2 cloves garlic, peeled", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "1 small onion, thinly sliced", "1/2 green bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced", "1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced", "1/4 cup tomato puree", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "1 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste", "salt and pepper to taste"], "minutes": 85}
