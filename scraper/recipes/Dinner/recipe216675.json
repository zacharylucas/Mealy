Divide the mixture into fourths, and form each fourth into a large patty. Refrigerate until time to grill.\nIf using onion rings, preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread frozen rings in a single layer on a baking sheet, and bake until hot and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set the onion rings aside.\nIn a large skillet, heat butter and olive oil; cook the onions until they begin to brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix in the sliced mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 10 to 15 more minutes. Set the onions and mushrooms aside.\nPlace the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nHeat 1 tablespoon of butter in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat until the foam disappears. Crack the eggs into a bowl, and gently pour them into the butter. Pan-fry the eggs until the whites are opaque and the eggs slide around the pan easily, about 1 minute; carefully flip each egg over in the skillet, avoiding breaking the yolk, and pan-fry for about 1 more minute. The whites should be firm but the yolks should be runny. Transfer the eggs to a plate.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Grill the venison burgers until they show grill marks and are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 5 to 8 minutes per side for well-done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). While still on the grill, gently top each burger with a fried egg and a slice of cheese. Lower the grill lid, and cook until the cheese has melted, about 1 minute.\nTo assemble, place the bottom half of a Kaiser roll onto a plate; spread with a layer of shredded lettuce, followed by tomato slices, the venison burger, a layer of mushrooms and onions, bacon slices, onion rings, avocado slices, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. Place the roll top onto the sandwich. Good luck.\n"}
