Drain off excess fat, and transfer the beef into a mixing bowl. Slice the zucchini in half the long way, and use a spoon to scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/2-inch thick shell all around the zucchini. Chop the scooped-out zucchini flesh, and add to mixing bowl. Stir in the bread crumbs, garlic, spaghetti sauce, black olives, and Parmesan cheese; mix the stuffing well. Lightly stuff both halves of the zucchini with the meat mixture. Place the zucchini halves into a baking dish, and cover tightly with foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, remove from oven, and remove the foil. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over each zucchini half. Move an oven rack to within 6 inches of the oven broiler's heat source, turn on the broiler, and broil the zucchini until the mozzarella cheese is browned and bubbling, about 5 minutes.\n", "title": "Easy Stuffed Zucchini", "ingredients": ["1/2 pound ground beef", "1 large zucchini, ends trimmed", "1/2 cup bread crumbs", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce", "1/2 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese", "1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese"], "minutes": 70}
