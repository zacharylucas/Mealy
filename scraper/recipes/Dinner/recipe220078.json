Add oil, onion and mushrooms, continue to cook 2-3 minutes or until tender. Reduce heat to medium-low.\nMeanwhile, in a separate saucepan, simmer stock and fresh herbs until ready to use.\nTo meat mixture, add rice, continue to stir until rice is hot and coated with oil. Add wine and continue to stir until the liquid is absorbed.\nRemove herbs from stick. Using a ladle, add about 1/2 cup of hot stock at a time to rice, stirring constantly after each addition until liquid is absorbed. When you have about 1 1/2 cups of stock remaining, add peas, salt and pepper, stir gently.\nThe risotto is done when all the stock has been absorbed, the rice is creamy in appearance and firm yet tender to the bite, (about 20-25 minutes total).
