Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nIn a large bowl, mix ground beef with adobo seasoning and powdered jalapeno pepper. Roll into small, 1 inch meatballs. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs, and cook until browned on all sides, then remove to drain on a paper towel-lined plate. The meatballs do not need to be thoroughly cooked at this point as they will finish cooking in the oven.\nWhile the meatballs are cooking, melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Gently cook the butter until it begins to brown, and acquires a nutty fragrance, about 1 minute. Stir in the cream, sour cream, Cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, cotija cheese, garlic powder, and cilantro. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly until the cheese has melted. Season to taste with salt and white pepper.\nStir the cooked macaroni and diced chiles into the cheese sauce, and pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Slice the meatballs in half, and place onto the pasta cut-side down.\nBake in preheated oven until the cheese sauce is bubbly, and the meatballs are no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes.\n", "title": "Southwestern Macaroni and Cheese with Adobo Meatballs", "ingredients": ["1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni", "3/4 pound lean ground beef", "3 tablespoons adobo seasoning", "2 teaspoons powdered jalapeno pepper", "2 teaspoons olive oil", "2 teaspoons butter", "1/4 cup cream", "1 cup light sour cream", "4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese", "2 cups fat-free cottage cheese", "1/2 cup crumbled cotija cheese", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro", "salt and white pepper to taste", "1 cup canned diced green chiles"], "minutes": 65}
