While the oil is heating, sift the flour, garlic salt, onion salt, (regular) salt, and paprika into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water so that the mixture can be drizzled from a spoon.\nDip potato slices into the batter one at a time, and place in the hot oil so they are not touching at first. The fries must be placed into the skillet one at a time, or they will clump together. Fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.\n", "title": "Homemade Crispy Seasoned French Fries", "ingredients": ["2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon garlic salt", "1 teaspoon onion salt", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon paprika", "1/2 cup water, or as needed", "1 cup vegetable oil for frying"], "minutes": 25}
