{"ingredients": ["2 cups semisweet chocolate chips", "1 1/2 cups sour cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "title": "Sour Cream Ganache", "instructions": "Place the chocolate chips into a glass or metal bowl, and set over the top of a pan of barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and transfer the chocolate to a medium bowl.\nAdd the sour cream and vanilla; beat with an electric mixture until smooth and creamy. If you let it cool down too much it will set up, so frost your cake while it is still liquid, or reheat before using.\n", "rating": 4.41025638580322, "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/4464259.jpg", "minutes": 20}
