{"minutes": 25, "title": "Quick Pour Fondant Icing", "rating": 3.26666665077209, "ingredients": ["6 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted", "1/2 cup water", "2 tablespoons light corn syrup", "1 teaspoon almond extract"], "instructions": "In a saucepan, combine confectioners' sugar, water and corn syrup. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches a temperature of 92 degrees F (33 degrees C.) Mixture should be thin enough to pour, but thick enough to coat cake. Stir in the almond extract.\nTo cover cake: frost cake smoothly with buttercream (see Editor's Note) and place on a cooling rack with a cookie sheet underneath. Pour fondant over iced cake, flowing from center and moving out in a circular motion. Touch up sides with a spatula.\nExcess fondant can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for about four weeks. Reheat over a double boiler just until pourable.\n", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/7316.jpg"}
