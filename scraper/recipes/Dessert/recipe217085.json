Grease and flour a tube pan.\nBeat the butter and cream cheese with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the sugar until well blended. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the 2 tablespoons flour with the last egg. Stir in the remaining 2 cups flour until just combined; stir in the mac, vanilla, and whiskey. Pour into the prepared tube pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.\n"}
