Divide and shape mixture into 24 balls, making 12 of them slightly larger than the other 12.\nSlide one larger ball and then one smaller ball onto each popsicle stick so they resemble snowballs stacked atop one another.\nFreeze pops until set, at least 1 hour.\nPut almond bark into a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave for 30 seconds, stir, and continue to heat in 15-second increments, stirring in between, until melted completely and smooth, 15 to 30 seconds more.\nRoll pops in melted almond bark to coat. Decorate the pops to resemble snowmen by using miniature chocolate chips for eyes, small round candies for shirt buttons, and pieces of orange candy for the nose.\nRefrigerate \"snowmen\" until set, at least 30 minutes.\n", "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/4091145.jpg"}
