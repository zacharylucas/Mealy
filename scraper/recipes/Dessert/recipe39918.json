{"ingredients": ["2 cups confectioners' sugar", "1/2 cup Dutch process cocoa powder", "3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, chilled and cubed", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 eggs", "1 cup chopped semisweet chocolate"], "title": "Emily's Famous Chocolate Shortbread Cookies", "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, stir together the confectioners' sugar, cocoa, flour and salt until well blended. Cut in the butter until lumps are no larger than peas. Add eggs and vanilla; mix until a stiff dough forms. It may take a minute to come together.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. If the dough is too sticky, chill for a little bit. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the surface appears dry. Allow cookies to cool for a couple minutes on the baking sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely. When cookies are completely cool, melt the chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave. Stir frequently until smooth. Dip cookies or drizzle with the chocolate and place on waxed paper to set.\n", "rating": 4.09375, "image": "https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/324704.jpg", "minutes": 30}
